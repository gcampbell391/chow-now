# Food Dude

A food recipe collection application built with React Native

A user can browse a collection of food recipes by categories. Each category 
contains different food items based off the category title. Each meal can be selected, and the the user can view meal ingredients, directions, and meal specifications. 
A user can also use a filter to help narrow their search for a specific item.
